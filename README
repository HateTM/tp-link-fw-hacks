Unpack and repack tool for TP-Link firmware (may work with other firmwares using safeload image format and ubi image)

Requirements:
python, python-pip, ubi_reader python module (pip install ubi_reader), squashfs-tools (apt install squashfs-tools), make, gcc, fakeroot

Usage:

NOTE: don't run this as root. you need to be in a directory with the stock firmware.

1. compile md5-fix utility, execute:
make

2. Unpack stock firmware with 01-unpack.sh, e.g.
./01-unpack.sh ax55v1-up-all-ver1-1-1-P1[20220621-rel71166]_sign_2022-06-21_20.01.15.bin

3. Run the cleanup script, it will purge all unecessary trash from the firmware. (WIP, there's more stuff to pull out)
./02-cleanup.sh

4. Enable SSH (optional) if you want to access your router. Edit the file and place your public key.
./03-enable-ssh.sh

5. Enable rc.local at boot (optional) if you want to run custom commands at the router startup.
./04-enable-rclocal.sh

6. Repack firmware with 05-repack.sh, e.g.
./05-repack.sh myfw.bin

7. Burn the firmware, if you are using the stock TPlink use the web interface and upload it. 
   - if you already have SSH access to the router drop the file on it and use nvrammanager -u myfw.bin to flash it from the command line


Enjoy your router free from Avira, Cloud, SmartHome, Alexa, Reports, Family Protect, Domain logins (tplinkwifi.net), Client manager (cloud stuff) and a bunch more of other stuff.


Read the scripts if you want to understand it better and how it works.
